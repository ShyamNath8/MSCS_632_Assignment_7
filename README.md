This project implements a statistics calculator in three different programming languages—C, OCaml, and Python—each demonstrating a different programming paradigm:

C → Procedural Programming

OCaml → Functional Programming

Python → Object-Oriented Programming

The program computes the Mean, Median, and Mode of a list of integers.

Program Description

Given a list of integers, compute:

Mean → average of the numbers

Median → middle value in the sorted list

Mode → most frequently occurring number(s)

Each language implements the same logic using its paradigm.

How to Run the Programs

1. C Version (Procedural)

Compile

gcc stats.c -o stats

Run

./stats

2. OCaml Version (Functional)

Compile

ocamlc stats.ml -o stats

Run

./stats

3. Python Version (Object-Oriented)

Run

python3 stats.py
